# Simple Powershell CLI

I did a series of posts over on [my blog here](https://barclaymcclay.au/powershell-cli/) that walk a PowerShell beginner through the code used to construct this.

# How to use

You need to open PowerShell **as an administrator**, and input:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force`

Then, navigate to the downlaoded repo with `cd`:

`cd "path\to\downloaded\repository"`

Once PowerShell is inside the 'Simple-PowerShell-CLI folder, run the main script:

`".\CLI_main.ps1"`
